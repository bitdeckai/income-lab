# Bounty PR Playbook

This workflow mirrors the PR+review+bounty flow in your screenshots.

## 1) Find claimable tasks
- Use `docs/bounty/live-opportunities.md`
- Prefer `score >= 4`
- Avoid already assigned issues unless maintainer invites collaboration

## 2) Claim publicly
- Comment on issue with:
  - understanding of scope
  - delivery ETA
  - test/proof plan

## 3) Deliver PR with proof
- Keep diff small and focused
- Include tests and logs/screenshots/video when required
- Link issue in PR description

## 4) Pass review quickly
- reply to each review comment with fix commit
- keep CI green
- avoid force-push without explanation

## 5) Collect payout
- follow project payout channel (Algora/IssueHunt/maintainer direct)
- provide merged PR link + issue link + proof if needed

## Daily Cadence
- 30 min: scan and shortlist
- 2-4 h: implement one task
- 30 min: review responses and follow-up
