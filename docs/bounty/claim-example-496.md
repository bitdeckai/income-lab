Hi, I'd like to claim this task: https://github.com/iotaledger/iota-rust-sdk/issues/496

Plan:
I will update Kotlin bindings build/release settings for Android usage, add Android README section, and provide a minimal Android demo calling one IOTA API with verification notes.

ETA: 2-3 days

I will submit a focused PR with tests and verification notes.
